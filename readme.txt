== Changelog ==

= 0.9 =

= 0.8 =
* You can set autoadvance true or false.
The autoadvance parameter controls whether or not the player automatically plays the next item in the playlist after the previous item is done playing. Setting autoadvance to "false" will tell the Yahoo! WebPlayer to NOT advance to the next track automatically once the current track finishes playing. The default value is true. 

= 0.7 =
* You can set autoplay true or false.
The autoplay parameter lets you start playing music as soon as your site's visitor lands on your page. Setting autoplay to "true" will start the first song automatically after the player loads. The default value is "false".

= 0.6 =
* You can set termDetection on or off.
Yahoo! WebPlayer looks for terms it recognizes in the text of a page and adds play buttons next to them. Then you can click "play" to watch related videos right there on the page. The default value is "off".
