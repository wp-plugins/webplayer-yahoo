== Changelog ==

= 1.5 =
You can set volume
It doesn't seem to work and I've put it in a different Postbox
The volume parameter sets the default volume of the Yahoo! WebPlayer on page load. The player expects a floating number between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.5, or 50%.

= 1.4 =
You can set linkConfig
linkconfig is brand new. We have not even had a chance to add it to the documentation.
Right now, it's only used to prevent play buttons from appearing next to youtube video page links

= 1.3 =
Postbox for a nicer configuration page

= 1.0 =
You can set defaultalbumart
The defaultalbumart parameter allows you to set your own image inside the Yahoo! WebPlayer that appears while audio is playing. This image appears to the right of the volume control, next to the item's title for all items in your playlist. A placeholder image will appear by default and no image will appear while video is playing.
We recommend 205px x 205px for best appearance. 
The default image in WebPlayer Yahoo! wordpress plugin is http://www.pivari.com/fabrizio-pivari-205x205.jpg

= 0.9 =
* Minor changes in code and documentation

= 0.8 =
* You can set autoadvance true or false.
The autoadvance parameter controls whether or not the player automatically plays the next item in the playlist after the previous item is done playing. Setting autoadvance to "false" will tell the Yahoo! WebPlayer to NOT advance to the next track automatically once the current track finishes playing. The default value is true. 

= 0.7 =
* You can set autoplay true or false.
The autoplay parameter lets you start playing music as soon as your site's visitor lands on your page. Setting autoplay to "true" will start the first song automatically after the player loads. The default value is "false".

= 0.6 =
* You can set termDetection on or off.
Yahoo! WebPlayer looks for terms it recognizes in the text of a page and adds play buttons next to them. Then you can click "play" to watch related videos right there on the page. The default value is "off".
